# NaoTK

Naoland toolkit. It's planned to be used as the toolkit for [Naoland](https://github.com/HatsuSixty/naoland), but I don't know if I will end up using it yet.

## Dependencies

- `meson` (only for building)
- `glfw`
- `rlgl` (from [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib))

## Quick Start

```console
$ meson setup build
$ meson compile -C build
$ ./build/example/example
```
